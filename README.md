## 🎯 Why It Was Made

After finishing my course, I wanted a project to:

- ✅ Practice my Blazor and .NET skills in a practical way
- ✅ Create something personally meaningful (I'm a bookworm 📖)
- ✅ Have a clean, working app I could show to recruiters

---

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

- ❌ **No login or database**: Simplifies the experience for users and recruiters reviewing the app
- 🌐 **OpenLibrary API**: A free and open-source API that provides book data, perfect for prototyping
- 🧪 Focused on **frontend logic** and **external data handling** to strengthen key Blazor skills
